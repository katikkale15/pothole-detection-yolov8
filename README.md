This project trains a custom YOLO v8 model on a dataset that was found on kaggle. The data was annotated using roboflow and the api key to use the annotated data is givin in the .ipynb notebook. The model made custom weights for that particular annotated dataset, these best weights were later used to evaluate the validation/test and a demo video. All of which are uploaded in the notebook.
